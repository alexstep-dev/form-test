# Installation

Make sure [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en) is installed on your machine. You need the latest LTS version.

You are able to check it using command in a terminal. **Git Bash** preferable!
> node -v

This is an example of execution of the command above:
```
$ node -v
v16.20.2
```

If you see a string which is similar to **vNN.NN.N**, it means you have already installed **Node.js**.


Or you can check it in **Start > Control Panel > Programs and Features**. There you can find Node.js among other installed applications.

# Running

Once it's done, run next commands one by one:
> npm install

> npm run dev

After execution of the last command you will see the next text in your console:
```
 VITE v5.4.3  ready in xxx ms

  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
